# Lab Work №6

1. Load the manipulator model from the toolbox according to the selected robot kinematics variant.  
2. Fill in all robot model parameters in accordance with Lab Work No. 1.  
3. Define the desired trajectory of the manipulator motion in accordance with Lab Work No. 2.  
4. Create a control system model for the robot that implements regulation based on impedance control.  
5. Tune the controller coefficients to minimize the end-effector position error.  
6. Plot the position, velocity, and torque for each robot link during motion along the trajectory.  
7. Add a payload and repeat steps 5–6.  
8. Prepare a report in `.ipynb` format with detailed comments. Draw conclusions based on the results of the work.
